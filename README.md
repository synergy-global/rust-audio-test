## Licensing
This project inherits the GPLv3 license from the VST3 bindings. If I could, I would license it with the MIT license, but as long as I rely on the official VST3 bindings this will remain GPLv3.

The dependencies have their respective licenses, including any Stoejmaskiner-owned libraries.
